	<h1>What's Needed Where?: Link Light Rail Analysis in Seattle</h1>
	<h2>Conclusion and Reflection</h2>
	<p>In the next few years Sound Transit is completing a large expansion of the Link Light Rail System, but it still will not be in key areas. So far Sound Transit has done a great job with the light rail system and will probably continue to expand into more areas. Based on all the separate maps created for this project it seems like the areas that are most in need of new transit are the West Seattle area, Burien area, Renton area, the Queen Anne area, and the north Seattle area. A follow up project would be finding where rail lines could be physically placed. This follow up project could include where new rail lines could be built along roads. It could also look at where new Park and Ride lots could be located to increase access to transit.

	<p>This project combined all the skills I learned in previous classes. It helped me consider the importance and impact of GIS maps in sharing information and making decisions. The project helped me practice formulating questions, researching a topic, gathering data, creating maps, and interpreting results. I was able to pursue my own ideas for a project and create something that has personal value to me. I can share my knowledge about light rail in terms of GIS. Studying light rail has now made me more aware of the importance of mass transit and the benefits of light rail. It also shows the inequalities in the Seattle area such as, unequal distribution of wealth, unequal land value, and lack of transportation options. This assignment has taught me how to pursue a topic on my own and create a substantial GIS project. This experience has helped me prepare for my professional career.
