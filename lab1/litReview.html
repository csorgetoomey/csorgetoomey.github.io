	<h1>What's Needed Where?: Link Light Rail Analysis in Seattle</h1>
	<h2>Literature Review</h2>
	<p>This project is aimed towards people who need increased access to public transit through light rail service. Light rail stations and lines in this study are built for the purpose of transit. When determining where light rail lines will be located, reducing traffic congestion is important. When there are no light rail lines in an area the traffic is dramatically worse (Anderson 2793). An additional benefit of building light rail lines and stations is the generation of more jobs and opportunities than road construction (LeRoy 57).

	<p>Many studies explore the need for public transit, especially for light rail. The benefits include more efficient travel, sustainable growth, job creation, reduced greenhouse gasses, and benefits to residents near light rail stops. Cities are restoring or expanding light rail because freeways cannot handle transportation needs (Allen 76). It is also important to create rail lines because some people cannot afford a car, and public transit is the only method of travel for them (LeRoy 58). As Edward Ziegler points out, there is not enough money to fund both roads and light rail in the future and a push towards an automobile-free built environment is needed in order to create sustainable growth (99; 93).

	<p>Public transit, including light rail, benefits both the environment and people. “Public transportation is the most effective way to reduce tailpipe emissions in this country” (LeRoy 56). Transportation sources are one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emission in the United States (Silverman 775). Individual residents near a new light rail stop also report benefits. In a study conducted by Barbara Brown, the participants who rode on new light rail routes were more satisfied with their neighborhood and were more positive about transit oriented development (5).

	<p>GIS is both a system for processing information and for creating and manipulating spatial images (Pickles 25). GIS maps are powerful and can define what is legitimate data while shaping debate and changing the way people think about issues (Dennis 2043). In GIS studies, accurate information needs to be gathered and presented in a straightforward way since the finished maps can define which data is considered legitimate. It is important to remember that GIS maps are not neutral and can have problems in representation (Harris 101). As much as possible the data in this study was carefully considered to ensure it was accurate and the resulting information presented clearly. It is also important to remember that GIS maps can be interpreted differently by various people. Further discussion of the maps in this project by others could increase understanding of the results and refine the maps themselves.
