						<h1>Predicting Tacoma's Future: <br> Gentrification and Light Rail Transit</h1>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<h3>Light rail systems in Tacoma have their roots beginning back all the way in the late 19th century. In 1888, the Tacoma Street Railway began service which consisted of horse drawn carriages that could hold up to 14 passengers. A couple years later in 1890, the first electric streetcar in Tacoma came into service. Many railway companies started up in the following years, but there were only three companies left by 1928, and the whole system died out by the mid 1930s</h3>
						<h3>About 60 years later Sound Transit restarted light rail in Tacoma with a vote in 1996 which approved a tax to build a new light rail line. Sound Transit completed five stations in 2003 and an additional station in 2011. There are three new extensions being constructed in the next couple decades. The Hilltop extension will be completed in 2022 and include six new stations and one relocated station. The Tacoma Dome extension will be completed in 2030 and add stations from the Tacoma Dome Station to Federal Way and Fife. The Tacoma Community College extension will be completed by 2039 and include five new stations from Hilltop to Tacoma Community College. </h3>
