						<h1>What's Needed Where? <br> Link Light Rail Analysis in Seattle</h1>
						<h2>Introduction</h2>
						<p>In the Greater Seattle Area, there has been a push to provide more public transit options for communities. During rush hour, there is a lot of traffic on the roads, which could be reduced with more public transit options. This traffic leads to longer commute times for everyone, since there are a lot of cars on the road, and they can slow down buses. In the Greater Seattle Area people need access to public transit for various reasons including work, school, daycare, shopping, medical appointments, entertainment, and visiting friends and family. There are also people who cannot afford cars, so they are stuck with only public transit options which can be limited. Public transit options can be especially limiting for people who need to commute to get to work and public transit is their only option.</p>
						<p>The area of study for this GIS project is the Greater Seattle Area. This project will focus on finding the general areas for new light rail services rather than specific locations or addresses. There is a great need for more public transit access in general around Seattle. This has already started becoming less of a problem because Sound Transit is planning to build new Link Light Rail stations and lines over the next ten to twenty years throughout the King County area. This area is experiencing great population growth. Combining existing population with new people means they all need some form of transportation to get different places, which causes a lot of traffic and congestion. There is a lot of opportunity for more public transportation in the Seattle area.</p>
						<p>This project aims to answer the question of which areas in the Greater Seattle Area would benefit most from increased light rail access, and whether or not there are gaps in the Link Light Rail System. The purpose of this project is to consider the current and proposed light rail lines to determine where new lines are needed most. This project investigates where people need better access to public transit and compares that to where the Link Light Rail stations are in the Seattle area. This analysis will determine where to place new Link Light Rail stations to be the most impactful for the most people. This study will include multiple public transit options and find where there is the least access for people with low incomes. Then the focus of the project is going to be on the Link Light Rail system. This paper will cover the methods used for the project and research, a discussion of the results, a literature review based on scholarly journal articles about light rail and GIS in general, and a conclusion and reflection.</p>
						<p>Originally the project included questions like: What can be done to help the people in these areas access transit? Including some smaller questions like: What kind of people need access to public transit? Is it commuters, so they have less of a commute time? People living in unfortunate circumstances who need access to public transit? As research and data was collected the focus became where new lines are needed most, especially for people with low income.</p>
